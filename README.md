# WScFi
A geant4 simulation codes
This is for a binary structure of forward EndCap calorimeter design. In each directory, some difference were made on the geometry.



the new7-25 means we are using mixture geometry for EMCal as a 75% of W and 25% of Polystyrene. Fe/Sc is 20/3 mm with 52 layers

the WScFi_ECalTowersMT is a geometry we have 796 fibers for each EMCal sector. Fe/Sc is 20/3 mm with 52 layers
