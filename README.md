# WScFi
A geant4 simulation codes
This is for a binary structure of forward EndCap calorimeter design. In each directory, some difference were made on the geometry.

Here the new6 is for x= 60cm y = 60 cm. W/ScFi inside 2.5 cm * 2.5 cm sectors. Fe/Sc is 20/3 mm with 51 layers.

the new7-25 means we are using mixture geometry for EMCal as a 75% of W and 25% of Polystyrene. Fe/Sc is 20/3 mm with 52 layers
