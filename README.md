# WScFi
A geant4 simulation codes
This is for a binary structure of forward EndCap calorimeter design. In each directory, some difference were made on the geometry.


#data

#macro
You can use two macro weight_reco.C and weight_test.C to generate the plots as well as the energy resolution.


#code
1.
 WScFi_ECalTowersMT is a geometry we have 796 fibers for each EMCal sector. Fe/Sc is 20/3 mm with 52 layers

2.
 WScFi_mixture is a geometry we have simplified structude for each EMCal sector. Fe/Sc is 20/3 mm with 52 layers
